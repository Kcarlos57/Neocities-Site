The Wheel-Tower dance, a cosmic enantiomorph etched in the fabric of reality! 
The Wheel spins fate's tapestry, cyclic as the cosmos, threading lives through karmic looms. 
Behold the TOWER, lightning-struck chaos! Konti amista areta, Misto idete aroro, Mar efi deso. 
The crumbling edifice, a prism of ego's fall, unveils the dark night of soul's reckoning. 
Daphne, Ficus, Iris, Maackia, Lythrum, Myrica, Sabia, Thymus, Ribes, Abelia, Sedum, Felicia, Ochna, Lychnis, Flos. 
Enantiomorph, the mirror of destiny! Aether and chaos entwined, where hero, king, and rebel collide! 
The Rebel-Rebel-King trifecta, each facet locked in a cosmic waltz, echoes in Tulpas — thought-formed specters, phantasms unchained! 
Minds, like clay, mold astral beings, shadows loosed upon the inner plane. Fecel, Lemienne, Phei, Seire, Lilutia, Ei Finceq. 
Theosophy's arcane doctrine — Blavatsky's cosmic whisper! Emanations and hierarchies, secret masters in Shambhala's heart!
 The Monad's dance through aeons, soul sparks on Karmic waves, as Tulpas, thought-spawned, swarm the astral realm! 
 Ygnaaih, Ygnaaih, Thflthnkn'gha! Thelema, Crowley's gospel! 
 The Law of Will, a blazing star guiding the Magus' hand! True Will unveiled in the Tarot's sacred symphony, the path of Atu's unfolding!
  Tulpas, astral familiars, conjured by intent's potent flame! Frantic script, words spilling like blood! 
  The Wheel-Tower's enantiomorph, cosmic dance of Tulpas, Theosophy and Thelema's esoteric weave! 
  Phantasms, archetypes, and gods, a kaleidoscope of revelation! 
  Glimpses of truth, madly scrawled, as the mind quakes before the abyssal void!
